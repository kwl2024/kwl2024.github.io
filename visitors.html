<LI>Arithmetic and Representation Theory Seminar, Nov 14, 11:05am, Vincent Hall 207: <I>Unitary Friedberg-Jacquet periods and their twists</I>
<SMALL><P>I discuss my joint work with Jingwei Xiao and Wei Zhang, where we formulate a global conjecture relating periods associated to certain symmetric spaces of unitary groups to central values of standard L-functions on linear groups, generalizing a theorem of Waldspurger for GL(2).  To attack this conjecture, we introduce a new family of relative trace formulas which we successfully compare under certain local assumptions to prove cases of the conjecture.  A new feature of this comparison is the presence of relative endoscopy: we need to affect an endoscopic comparison of relative trace formulas to establish the global results.  All of this relies on establishing several new local results.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Nov 13, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>L-functions and periods</I>
<SMALL><P>Zeta and L-functions play a central role in modern number theory.  In this talk, I will discuss some classical contexts where these functions and their properties arise and how we can study them via a different kind of analytic object: a modular or automorphic form.  The process of relating a modular form to an L-function is by forming  a "period integral".  My goal is to give a sense (through examples) of how the study of periods has taken a central place in the so-called relative Langlands program.  No familiarity with automorphic forms is expected.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Arithmetic and Representation Theory Seminar, Oct 17, 11:05am, Vincent Hall 207: <I>Integral Sen operator and integral filtrations attached to crystalline representation</I>
<SMALL><P>We construct the integral Sen operator and various (Nygaard, conjugate, Hodge) filtrations attached to integral crystalline representations, which Gee-Kisin and Bhatt-Gee-Kisin use to understand the reduction of crystalline representations.  Our methods are more explicit and allow us to extend their constructions to more general settings.  This is a joint work with Hui Gao.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Oct 16, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>Hypergeometric functions and Galois representations</I>
<SMALL><P>The study of hypergeometric functions has a rich history, deeply rooted in analysis, geometry, combinatorics, and number theory.  A modern approach to understanding these functions involves examining their associated Galois representations.  Since hypergeometric Galois representations naturally arise from algebraic geometry, the Langlands program predicts that they should correspond to automorphic representations.  In this talk, we present recent progress and results in this direction.  This is joint work with Wen-Ching Winnie Li and Ling Long.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Sep 25, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>On the classification of highly-connected manifolds</I>
<SMALL><P>One of the classic questions in geometric topology asks: can we classify manifolds?  This problem has been approached from many perspectives: for example, by classifying manifolds of a fixed low dimension, or manifolds which admit metrics with certain curvature properties.</P>

<P>In this talk, I will discuss the classification of highly-connected smooth manifolds&mdash;a class of manifolds whose topology is particularly simple.  This classification problem has a long history in the study of geometric topology&mdash;in the 1950s, Milnor's study of this problem led to his discovery of exotic spheres.  I will survey this classical problem and discuss its solution, which builds on the work of many people, including Wall and Stolz.  This solution, obtained in joint works with Burklund, Hahn and Zhang, relies on modern techniques in homotopy theory.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Sep 4, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>Algebraic solutions to differential equations</I>
<SMALL><P>When does an algebraic differential equation have a solution which is itself an algebraic function?  This question has animated much mathematics since the 19th century--for example, Schwarz answered it in 1873 for hypergeometric functions, while algebraic solutions to the Painlev&eacute; VI equation were only classified in 2014.  I'll describe a number of concrete arithmetic conjectures on this topic, due to Grothendieck, Katz, and others, and some recent progress for both linear and nonlinear differential equations.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Apr 17, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>From the sparsity of rational points on curves to the generic positivity of the Beilinson-Bloch height</I>
<SMALL><P>It is a fundamental question to find rational solutions to a given system of polynomials, and in modern language this translates into finding rational points in algebraic varieties.  It is already very deep for algebraic curves defined over Q.  An intrinsic natural number associated with the curve, called its genus, plays an important role in studying rational points on curves.  In 1983, Faltings proved the famous Mordell Conjecture (proposed in 1922), which asserts that any curve of genus at least 2 has only finitely many rational points.  Thus the problem for curves of genus at least 2 can be divided into several grades: finiteness, bound, uniform bound, effectiveness.  An answer to each grade requires a better understanding of the distribution of the rational points.</P>

<P> In my talk, I will explain the historical and recent developments of this problem according to the different grades.  I will also mention a recent work (joint with Shouwu Zhang) about a generic positivity property and a Northcott property of the Beilinson-Bloch height of the Gross-Schoen cycles and the Ceresa cycles.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Feb 27, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>What is the geometric Langlands conjecture?</I>
<SMALL><P>The Langlands program originated in a series of conjectures formulated by Robert Langlands in late 1960's.  A geometric version of the conjectures relates two natural spaces associated to a Riemann surface: the space of vector bundles and the space of local systems.  The geometric Langlands program went through several transformations and grew to connect many areas of mathematics.</P>

<P>My goal is to provide an informal introduction to the (global) geometric Langlands conjecture, and sketch some recent developments, combining classical ideas and modern tools.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Sep 12, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>Total positivity: combinatorics, geometry and representation theory</I>
<SMALL><P>An invertible matrix is called totally positive if all its minors are positive.  In 1994, Lusztig developed the theory of total positivity for arbitrary split real reductive groups and their flag manifolds.  He further generalized the theory to arbitrary Kac-Moody groups in 2019.  The theory of total positivity has found important applications in different areas: cluster algebras, higher Teichmuller theory, the theory of amplituhedron in physics, etc.</P>

<P>In this talk, we will discuss some remarkable combinatorial, geometric and representation-theoretic aspects of total positivity.  This talk is based on some recent works with Huanchen Bao.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Ordway Lecture Series, Sep 10, 10am, Sep 13, 1:30pm, and Sep 17, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 570: <I>Cocenters of Hecke algebras/categories</I>
<SMALL><P>It is known that the number of conjugacy classes of a finite group equals the number of irreducible representations (over complex numbers).  The conjugacy classes of a finite group give a natural basis of the cocenter of its group algebra.  Thus the above equality can be reformulated as a duality between the cocenter of the group algebra and the Grothendieck group of its finite dimensional representations.</P>

<P>The situation becomes more complicated, yet more interesting, if the group algebras are replaced by the Hecke algebras.  In the three talks, I will explore some aspects of the theory of cocenters, with applications to arithmetic geometry and representation theory.</P>

<P>In the first talk, I will focus on the structure of the cocenter of affine Hecke algebras, with an explicit example on the affine Hecke algebra for $SL_2$, and discuss some applications to the affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties;</P>

<P>In the second talk, I will discuss the cocenter of the "big" Hecke algebras of reductive $p$-adic groups, and some applications to the representation theory, including the Howe's conjecture and trace Paley-Wiener theorem;</P>

<P>In the third talk, I will discuss a categorical version of the cocenters we discussed in the first two talks, and will explain the semi-orthogonal decomposition of the sheaves on the quotient stack of loop groups and the categorical cocenter of the affine Hecke categories.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Seminar on Arithmetic Geometry, Apr 22, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 364: <I>Log prismatic Dieudonne theory and an application to Shimura varieties</I>
<SMALL><P>Recently, Imai-Kato-Youcis constructed a prismatic F-crystal with G-structure on the integral model of the Shimura variety associated to Abelian type Shimura datum (G, X).  This object can be regarded as the prismatic realization of the 'universal G-motive' on a Shimura variety.  In this talk, we extend this object to a log prismatic F-crystal on the toroidal compactification of a Shimura variety of Hodge type by establishing log prismatic Dieudonne theory.  If time permits, we will also talk about our future work.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Nov 9, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>K&auml;hler-Einstein metric, K-stability and moduli spaces</I>
<SMALL><P>A complex variety with a positive first Chern class is called a Fano variety.  The question of whether a Fano variety has a K&auml;hler-Einstein metric has been a major topic in complex geometry since the 1980s.  In the last decade, algebraic geometry, or more specifically higher dimensional geometry has played a surprising role in advancing our understanding of this problem.  In fact, the algebraic part of this question is one step of a larger project, namely constructing projective moduli spaces that parametrize Fano varieties satisfying the K-stability condition.  The latter is exactly the algebraic characterization of the existence of a K&auml;hler-Einstein metric.  In the lecture, I will explain the main ideas behind the recent progress of the field.</P></SMALL>

There have been slow but steady advances in this program, with geometric flavors and harmonic analytic flavors.

<LI>Lie Theory Seminar, Sep 15, 11:15am, Vincent Hall 206: <I>Arthur packets and generalized endoscopy for real reductive groups</I>
<SMALL><P>Let G and H be real reductive groups.  To any L-homomorphism e : H^L -> G^L one can associate a map e_* from virtual representations of H to virtual representations of G.  This map was predicted by Langlands and defined (in the real case) by Adams, Barbasch, and Vogan.  Without further restrictions on e, this map can be very poorly behaved.  A special case in which e_* exhibits especially nice behavior is the case when H is an endoscopic group.  In this talk, I will introduce a more general class of groups which exhibit similar behavior.  I will explain how this generalized version of endoscopic lifting can be used to prove the unitarity of many Arthur packets.  This is based on joint work with Jeffrey Adams and David Vogan.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Sep 14, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>Unitary representations of semisimple Lie groups and conical symplectic singularities</I>
<SMALL><P>One of the most fundamental unsolved problems in representation theory is to classify the set of irreducible unitary representations of a semisimple Lie group.  In this talk, I will define a class of such representations coming from filtered quantizations of certain graded Poisson varieties.  The representations I construct are expected to form the "building blocks" of all unitary representations.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Apr 20, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>Fourier analysis beyond vector spaces</I>
<SMALL><P>The Fourier transform and Poisson summation formula on a vector space have a venerable place in mathematics.  It has recently become clear that they are but the first case of general phenomena.  Namely, conjectures of Braverman, Kazhdan, L. Lafforgue, Ngo and Sakellaridis suggest that one can define Fourier transforms and prove Poisson summation formulae whenever the vector space is replaced by a so-called spherical variety satisfying certain desiderata.  In this talk I will focus on what has been proven in this direction for a particular family of spherical varieties related to flag varieties.  A simple (but nontrivial) example is the zero locus of a nondegenerate quadratic form.  Kazhdan believes that these generalized Fourier transforms and Poisson summation formulae will eventually have many applications throughout mathematics.  I agree, and to expedite these applications I will present them in a format that is as accessible as possible.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Mar 2, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>Categorical diagonalization</I>
<SMALL><P>We know what it means to diagonalize an operator in linear algebra.  What might it mean to diagonalize a functor?</P>

<P>Given a linear operator f whose characteristic polynomial is multiplicity-free, we can construct projection to each eigenspace as a polynomial in f, using a technique known as Lagrange interpolation.  We think of the process of finding a complete family of orthogonal idempotents as the diagonalization of f.  After reviewing this we provide a categorical analogue: given a functor F with some additional data (akin to the set of eigenvalues), we construct idempotent functors projecting to "eigencategories."  Along the way we'll explain some of the basic concepts in categorification.</P>

<P>Diagonalization is incredibly important in every field of mathematics.  I am a representation theorist, so I will briefly indicate some of the important applications of categorical diagonalization to representation theory.  I'll also indicate applications to algebraic geometry.</P>

<P>In this talk we will follow a running example involving modules over the ring Z[x]/(x^2 - 1), in other words, the group algebra of the group of size 2.  If you know what a complex of modules is (and what chain maps and homotopies are) then you have all the prerequisites needed for this talk.</P>

<LI>Colloquium, Nov 17, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>Local Multiplicity for spherical varieties</I>
<SMALL><P>Let G be a reductive group and H be a closed subgroup of G.  We say H is a spherical subgroup of G if there exists a Borel subgroup B of G such that BH is Zariski open in G.  (I will explain what the above terminologies mean in my talk.)  One of the fundamental problems in the relative Langlands program is to study the multiplicity problem for the pair (G,H), i.e. to study the restriction of a representation of G to H.  In this talk, I will first recall the multiplicity problem in the finite group case and in the Lie group case.  Then I will go over the general conjecture and all the known results for the multiplicity problem of spherical varieties.  Lastly, I will explain how to use the trace formula method to study this problem.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Lie Theory Seminar, Nov 11, 10am, Vincent Hall 6: <I>Covers of reductive groups and functoriality</I>
<SMALL><P>To a connected reductive group G over a local field F we define a compact topological group \tilde\pi_1(G) and an extension G(F)_\infty of G(F) by \tilde\pi_1(G).  From any character x of \tilde\pi_1(G) of order n we obtain an n-fold cover G(F)_x of the topological group G(F).  We also define an L-group for G(F)_x, which is a usually non-split extension of the Galois group by the dual group of G, and deduce from the linear case a refined local Langlands correspondence between genuine representations of G(F)_x and L-parameters valued in this L-group.</P>

<P>This construction is motivated by Langlands functoriality.  We show that a subgroup of the L-group of G of a certain kind naturally leads to a smaller quasi-split group H and a double cover of H(F).  Genuine representations of this double cover are expected to be in a functorial relationship with representations of G(F).  We will present two concrete applications of this, one that gives a characterization of the local Langlands correspondence for supercuspidal L-parameters when p is sufficiently large, and one to the theory of endoscopy.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Nov 10, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>Representations of reductive groups over local fields</I>
<SMALL><P>The pioneering work of Langlands has established the theory of reductive algebraic groups and their representations as a key part of modern number theory.  I will survey classical and modern results in the representation theory of reductive groups over local fields (the fields of real, complex, or p-adic numbers, or of Laurent series over finite fields) and discuss how they relate to Langlands' ideas, as well as to the various reflections of the basic mathematical idea of symmetry in arithmetic and geometry.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Oct 13, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16 (hybrid mode): <I>Equidistribution and reciprocity in number theory</I>
<SMALL><P>A famous result in number theory is Dirichlet's theorem that there exist infinitely many prime numbers in any given arithmetic progression a, a + N, a + 2 N, ... where a, N are coprime.  In fact, a stronger statement holds: the primes are equidistributed in the different residue classes modulo N.  In order to prove his theorem, Dirichlet introduced Dirichlet L-functions, which are analogues of the Riemann zeta function which depend on a choice of character of the group of units modulo N.</P>

<P>More general L-functions appear throughout number theory and are closely connected with equidistribution questions, such as the Sato--Tate conjecture (concerning the number of solutions to y^2 = x^3 + a x + b in the finite field with p elements, as the prime p varies).  L-functions also play a central role in both the motivation for and the formulation of the Langlands conjectures in the theory of the automorphic forms.</P>

<LI>Colloquium, Apr 7, 3:30pm, online: <I>Complex multiplication for real quadratic fields</I>
<SMALL><P>The theory of complex multiplication developed in the 19th century for imaginary quadratic fields via the moduli of elliptic curves with complex multiplication, and extended by Shimura, Taniyama and Weil to CM fields, leads to (a partial) explicit class field theory for these base fields.  The case where the base field is not a CM field appears more mysterious.  I will describe a largely conjectural approach, for the simplest case of real quadratic fields, which rests on replacing modular functions by "rigid meromorphic cocycles".  This is an account of ongoing joint work with Alice Pozzi and Jan Vonk.</P></SMALL>

<SMALL><P>In the second talk, we will move to certain high dimensional varieties (such as the product of several elliptic curves) over number fields, where, instead of rational points, we want to search for (or to show finiteness of) algebraic cycles (i.e., parameter solutions) modulo suitable equivalence relations (rational equivalence, Abel-Jacobi or its p-adic variants).  In particular, we'll report some recent results on a conjecture of Beilinson/Bloch-Kato and the role of the Gan-Gross-Prasad (or the arithmetic diagonal) cycle in the proof.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Apr 5, 3:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>Rational points on  intersections of two quadrics</I>
<SMALL><P>A very common theme in number theory (and many other areas) is the study of various "local-to-global principles", such as the Hasse-Minkowski theorem for rational points on a quadric.  The three talks will be devoted to several such instances in the context of rational points/algebraic cycles on varieties over  global fields and their relation to special values of L-functions.  In the first talk (colloquium), we will discuss the Hasse principle for rational points on intersection of two quadrics in P^N over function fields (of algebraic curves over a finite field).  Among other things, the new tools here include an on-going work with Zhiwei Yun to establish a function field analog of (a strengthened) Kolyvagin's theorem for elliptic curves and our previous work on a Higher Gross-Zagier formula relating intersection numbers of certain cycles on moduli space of Drinfeld Shtukas to L-functions of elliptic curves.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Mar 31, 3:30pm, online: <I>Unlikely intersections and the Andre-Oort conjecture</I>
<SMALL><P>The Andre-Oort conjecture concerns special points of a Shimura variety S --- points that are in a certain sense "maximally symmetric".  It states that if a variety V in S contains a zariski-dense set of such points, then V must itself be a Shimura variety.  It is an example of the field now known as "unlikely intersections theory" which seeks to explain "arithmetic coincidences" using geometry.  In fact, there is a very natural sense in which the Andre-Oort conjecture can be seen as an analogue of Faltings theorem concerning rational points on curves.  The proof of this conjecture involves a wide range of disparate mathematical ideas ---functional transcendence, mondromy, point counting in transcendental sets, upper bounds for arithmetic complexity (heights of special points), and p-adic hodge theory.  We will survey these concepts and how they relate to each other in the proof, aiming to give an overview of the relevant ideas.  We will also discuss the current status of the field, now spearheaded by the (still extremely open!) Zilber-Pink conjecture, and what is required to make further progress.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Mar 3, 3:30pm, online: <I>The unbounded denominators conjecture</I>
<SMALL><P>The unbounded denominators conjecture, first raised by Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer in 1968, asserts that a modular form for a finite index subgroup of SL_2(Z) whose Fourier coefficients have bounded denominators must be a modular form for some congruence subgroup.  Our proof of this conjecture is based on a new arithmetic algebraization theorem, which has its root in the classical Borel--Dwork rationality criterion. In this talk, we will discuss some ingredients in the proof and a variant of our arithmetic algebraization theorem, which we will use to prove the irrationality of certain 2-adic zeta value.  This is joint work with Frank Calegari and Vesselin Dimitrov.</P></SMALL>

However, the properties of these groups are not well understood, and it is a difficult problem to exhibit explicit classes in motivic cohomology.  We will construct such classes in the special fiber of Hilbert modular varieties by using the geometry of the supersingular locus.  The construction is related to a geometric realization of the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence, as well as to level raising for Hilbert modular forms.  A key ingredient is a form of Ihara's Lemma for compact quaternionic Shimura surfaces.</P></SMALL>

<SMALL><P>Affine Deligne&ndash;Lusztig varieties (ADLV) naturally arise in the study of Shimura varieties and Rapoport&ndash;Zink spaces.  Their irreducible components provide an interesting class of cycles on the special fiber of Shimura varieties.  We prove a conjecture of Miaofen Chen and Xinwen Zhu, which relates the number of irreducible components of ADLV's to a certain weight multiplicity for a representation of the Langlands dual group.  Our approach is to count the number of F_q points as q goes to infinity; this boils down to computing a certain twisted orbital integral.  After applying techniques from local harmonic analysis, we reduce to computing a particular coefficient of the matrix for the inverse Satake transform.  Using an interpretation of this coefficient in terms of a q-analogue of Kostant's partition function, we are able to reduce the problem to the previously known special cases of the conjecture proved by Hamacher&ndash;Viehmann and Nie.  This is joint work with Yihang Zhu.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Special Number Theory Seminar, Oct 4, 1:25pm, Vincent Hall 313: <I>The Langlands-Kottwitz-Scholze method for Shimura varieties of abelian type</I>
<SMALL><P>The local (and global) Langlands conjectures attempt to bridge the major areas of harmonic analysis and number theory by forming a correspondence between representations which naturally appear in both areas.  A key insight due to Langlands and Kottwitz is that one could attempt to understand such a conjectural correspondence by comparing the traces of natural operators on both sides of the bridge.  Moreover, it was realized that Shimura varieties present a natural means of doing this.  For global applications, questions of reduction type (at a particular prime p) for these Shimura varieties can often be avoided, and for this reason the methods of Langlands and Kottwitz focused largely on the setting of good reduction.  But, for local applications dealing with the case of bad reduction is key.  The setting of bad reduction was first dealt with, for some simple Shimura varieties, by Harris and Taylor which they used, together with the work of many other mathematicians, to prove the local Langlands conjecture for GL_n.  A decade later Scholze gave an alternative, more geometric, way to understand the case of bad reduction for certain Shimura varieties and was able to reprove the local Langlands conjecture for GL_n.  In this talk we will discuss an extension of the ideas of Scholze to a wider class of Shimura varieties, as well as the intended application of these ideas to the local Langlands conjectures for more general groups.</P></SMALL>

The key innovation of this work is the construction of a p-adic cohomology theory that interpolates between known cohomology theories in p-adic geometry (such as p-adic etale cohomology and de Rham cohomology).  In this talk, I shall discuss this construction and explain why it is closely related to certain periodicity theorems (such as Bott's and Bokstedt's) in homotopy theory.

I will also explain why similar ideas help establish a derived variant of the DSC put forth by de Jong; the latter roughly states that regular rings have rational singularities.  One of my main goals in this talk to explain why passing from a mixed characteristic ring to a perfectoid extension is a useable analogue of the passage to the perfection (direct limit over Frobenius) in characteristic p.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Apr 26, 2:30pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>Bounding torsion in cohomology</I>
<SMALL><P>The integral cohomology groups of a complex algebraic variety are one of the most fundamental invariants associated to the variety.  The ranks of these groups are well understood in terms of the equations defining the variety, thanks to Hodge theory.  However, the torsion tends to be more "transcendental" in nature and is not easily accessible via algebraic techniques.  Torsion cohomology classes have played a pivotal role in many recent advances in number theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory, so it is important to better understand torsion from an algebraic perspective.  In this talk, I'll discuss my recent work with Morrow and Scholze that explains how to bound the torsion explicitly in terms of the equations defining the variety.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Ordway Lecture Series, Apr 24, 10:10am, Vincent Hall 16: <I>Introduction to perfectoid spaces</I>
<SMALL><P>Perfectoid geometry is a relatively newly uncovered corner of arithmetic geometry.  It provides a context where we can fruitfully treat a prime number like a variable, thus opening the door to systematically applying algebro-geometric techniques to problems in arithmetic.  Consequently, these spaces have already solved important problems not only in number theory, but also in algebraic geometry, representation theory, commutative algebra, and even homotopy theory.  In this talk, I will introduce the basic notions of perfectoid geometry.  The goal is to introduce the background necessary to follow the applications discussed in the following talks.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Automorphic Forms and Number Theory Seminar, May 1, 3:35pm, Vincent Hall 6: <I>The Hasse-Weil zeta functions of orthogonal Shimura varieties</I>
<SMALL><P>Initiated by Langlands, the problem of comparing the Hasse-Weil zeta functions of Shimura varieties with automorphic L-functions has received continual study.  The strategy proposed by Langlands, later made more precise by Kottwitz, is to compare the Grothendieck-Lefschetz trace formula for Shimura varieties with the trace formula for automorphic forms.  Recently the program has been extended to some Shimura varieties not treated before.  In the particular case of orthogonal Shimura varieties, we discuss the proof of Kottwitz's conjectural comparison (between the intersection cohomology of their minimal compactifications and the stable trace formulas).  Key ingredients include point counting on these Shimura varieties, Morel's theorem on intersection cohomology, and explicit computation in representation theory mostly for real Lie groups.</P></SMALL>

It turns out to be intimately connected to the Weil conjectures, a statement about the cohomology of projective, smooth varieties defined over finite fields.</P>

<LI>Lie Theory Seminar, Sep 20, 3:30pm, Vincent Hall 207: <I>Some new developments with algebraic groups</I>
<SMALL><P>The theory of reductive groups is very useful and beautiful, and over perfect fields one can reduce general questions about linear algebraic groups to the reductive case (where the rich structure theory provides a lot of insight and technique).  However, over imperfect fields (such as local and global function fields over finite fields) there is a substantial gap between general linear algebraic groups and reductive ones, and for problems sensitive to the ground field it is the class of pseudo-reductive groups that relate better to the general case.</P>

<P>In the first half of the talk, I will discuss why it is useful to think about general linear algebraic groups and survey some earlier results with Gabber and G. Prasad on pseudo-reductive groups, both examples/applications and especially a general structure theorem.  The structure theorem comes with a catch: in characteristic 2 the ground field k must satisfy [k:k^2] = 2.  This degree restriction is genuine insofar as there is a blizzard of phenomena that arise if and only if [k:k^2] 2.</P>

<P>In the second half of the talk, I will present examples to illustrate what goes wrong when [k:k^2] 2, indicate some new constructions that only exist in those cases, and formulate a general structure theorem over all such fields, thereby completing the search for an adequate structure theorem over pseudo-reductive groups over all imperfect fields.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Lie Theory Seminar, Mar 15, 3:30pm, Vincent Hall 207: <I>Parity in the cohomology of algebraic varieties</I>
<SMALL><P>An old question of Serre (which also appeared in Deligne's Weil II) asks whether the odd-degree &#8467;-adic Betti numbers of any proper smooth variety (of any characteristic) are necessarily even.  I'll give an answer in the affirmative, and then discuss subsequent, more refined questions by Serre and by Katz.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Lie Theory Seminar, Nov 16, 3:30pm, Vincent Hall 206: <I>Epipelagic L-packets and rectifying characters</I>
<SMALL><P>We will report on a construction of the local Langlands correspondence for general tamely-ramified p-adic groups and a class of wildly ramified supercuspidal Langlands parameters that have emerged in recent works of Gross-Reeder and Reeder-Yu.  The ramification of these parameters introduces two new arithmetic phenomena which were not present in the case of real groups or in the case of tamely-ramified supercuspidal parameters for p-adic groups.  We will discuss how these phenomena can be handled and, time permitting, we will give an indication of how the various compatibilities expected of a Langlands correspondence are proved.  These include in particular Shahidi's tempered L-packet conjecture, stability, endoscopic transfer, and compatibility with GL_n.</P></SMALL>

<LI>Colloquium, Nov 15, 3:35pm, Vincent Hall 16: <I>The symmetry in numbers</I>
<SMALL><P>The work of Galois in the early 19th century showed that the arithmetic of the rational numbers is reflected in a mysterious set of symmetries, known as the Galois group of Q.  In the late 19th century, Felix Klein in his Erlangen program introduced the notion of symmetry into geometry.  This geometric symmetry arises in the form of Lie-groups, seemingly quite different in nature from the Galois groups.  In the 1960's, Robert Langlands developed a tantalizing web of conjectures relating the two notions of symmetry.  He postulated that the Galois group of Q bears a close and specific elation to certain Lie groups well known in geometry, including the linear, symplectic, and orthogonal groups.  An example of the fruitful and surprising results arising from such a relationship would be that the different algebraic extensions of Q of degree n are governed by infinite-dimensional representations of the general linear group GL_n.</P>

<P>I will introduce some of the ideas surrounding Langlands' conjectures and then focus on more recent developments involving the so called local side of these conjectures, in which the rational numbers are replaced by the p-adic numbers.</P></SMALL>
